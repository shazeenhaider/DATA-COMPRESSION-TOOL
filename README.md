compression tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm is like finding a smarter way to store repetitive information — just the way humans simplify long tasks. Imagine you're reading a sentence like “AAAAAAABBBCCCCDD”. Instead of writing all those letters repeatedly, a person might naturally say “A7B3C4D2” — and that’s exactly what RLE does. It’s a simple yet powerful method of compressing data by reducing redundancy.

The structure ofthe program typically involves reading input from a file or string, using loops and counters to detect repeating characters, and writing the compressed form to another file.
We also write the decompression part of the program — so that the original data can be recovered. Just like a human can look at “A5B2” and mentally picture “AAAAABB”, the program reads each character followed by its count and reconstructs the original string. This way, the system becomes a complete compression-decompression tool.

Making a program like this teaches us how computers can mimic human logic — noticing patterns, reducing repetition, and storing information more efficiently. It shows how basic human problem-solving ideas can turn into algorithms, and those algorithms can power real-world tools, from file compressors to image processing software.
